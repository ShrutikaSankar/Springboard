"FROM TEXAS 2013- Oct 2020  A really great 2 wheel drive vehicle, born and bred in TX until last month when my family and I moved back to Central NY.  Even though a 2013, no rust, because it was mostly just for highway driving around TX (back and forth to work).  I bought it used from a dealer down there at under 40k miles, and it's been great.    In late Summer, I paid to put a whole new AC system in.  Last week, replaced the whole windshield and put two new fog lights in.  September, new brakes and rotors.  My 1 yr old baby rides in this car, so I always make sure to keep up regular maintenance and have all the old records of it's maintenance that will go with the car.    This car has a lot of life left in it and will make somebody a good car.  Minor body damage in the front as shown in the pictures.  Somebody got me in the parking lot and drove away.  No mechanical damage though, just cosmetic.
